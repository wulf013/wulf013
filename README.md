# About Me
I am currently taking more than a year off from college, for various reasons; but primarily to give myself a break. I'm working on my BS of Computer Science at St. Mary's University, with minors in Mathematics and Philosophy. I have a passion for video games, data science, and the programming languages.

## What I am working on
I am currently working on a number of personal projects, but my focus right now is building a search engine for TopGame Podcast transcripts.
